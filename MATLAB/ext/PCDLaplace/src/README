This file contains information about the PCDLaplace code which computes the 
Laplace operator from point cloud based on the paper "Constructing Laplace 
Operator from Point Clouds in $R^d$",  Mikhail Belkin, Jian Sun and Yusu Wang, 
SODA 2009.  The code is written by jian sun.  

The source code as well as the binary code is distributed for Linux. 
The source code is ready to be compiled on other platform though it
is not tested. 

DESCRIPTION
	The PCDLaplace program reads an input file which contains the coordinates of
	the input point cloud and compute the point cloud laplace matrix. The program is
	written in C++, see lpmatrix.h for the routines that compute the laplace
	matrix.  It also provides matlab interface: pcdlp_matrix.m, which has self
	contained desription. eigen_demo.m gives an example on computing the
   eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the laplace operator, and fun_demo give 
	an example on applying the laplace operator on a fixed function.
