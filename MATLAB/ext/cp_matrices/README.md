readply:
    MATLAB functions to read and write 3D data PLY files
    by Pascal Getreuer, 2004.  License: unknown.
    This code doesn't seem to work in Octave but I haven't
    tried to fix it.

ba_interp:
    fast matlab interpolation (not currently included in this
    code, but very useful).

surfaces:
    Some surface triangulations are included in surfaces/tri/
    Each should have a README file associated with it.
    These are mostly from Aim@Shape and probably have their own licenses.
