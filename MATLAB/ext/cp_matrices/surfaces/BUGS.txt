bug #1:
  we need an issue tracker

bug #2:
  Tom's cpPolygon code returns incorrect signdist (sometimes 0 off the surface)
  There is a unit test that shows this failing.

bug #3:, closed
  There is no torus CP function.  Jeff Springer is supposed to be working on this.

bug #4:
  cpParamCurveOpen.m has been renamed (pending vectorization).  So use cpParamCurveOpen_oldloop() for now.

bug #5: FIXED 2012-07-01
  cpSurfOfRevolution not working yet

bug #6: move cpPolygon out of subdir, move support code to private, maybe take a look at bugs above first
