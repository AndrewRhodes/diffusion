Surfaces for use with the Closest Point Method
==============================================

These are Matlab implementations of closest point representations of
surfaces.

cpSphere etc are closest point functions.

paramSphere etc are parameterizations, good for plotting.

tri2cp/ is code, written in C and linked to Matlab with Mex for
converting triangulations into closest point representations.
