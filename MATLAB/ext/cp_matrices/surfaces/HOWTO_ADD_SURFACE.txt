How to add a new surface:

1)  make a cpFoobar file

* [cpx,cpy] = cpFoobar(x,y)

* should return dist or signed distance as appropriate/possible:
  [cpx,cpy,dist] = cpFoobar(x,y)
  [cpx,cpy,sdist] = cpFoobar(x,y)

* should return a boundary indication if possible:
  [cpx,cpy,dist,bdy] = cpFoobar(x,y)

* must be vectorized (but could fake it internally of course).


2)  make a paramFoobar file

* [x,y] = paramFoobar(n)

* all other inputs should take default values except n (this is useful
  for unit tests).

* This is optional (cpLine doesn't have one for example).

* default inputs should match those of your cpFoobar function.

* If the surface is 1D (a curve or filament) then x and y (and z etc)
  should be column vectors.
