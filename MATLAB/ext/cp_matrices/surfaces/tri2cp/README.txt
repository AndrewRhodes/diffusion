mex based C utility to convert triangles to closest point representation

2011-09-30: adding a new version which uses uthash (uthash.sf.net) instead of search.h hash table, hopefully this will work on windows

2011-10: Note: this could/should be modified to detect boundaries
               (based on the number of shared edges)
